title = Use Case Description
content = Face detector based on SqueezeNet light (half-channels) as a backbone with a single SSD for indoor/outdoor scenes shot by a front-facing camera. The backbone consists of fire modules to reduce the number of computations. The single SSD head from 1/16 scale feature map has nine clustered prior boxes.

[inputs]
content = Image, name: input, shape: 1, 3, 300, 300 in the format B, C, H, W, where:
layout = BCHW

[outputs]
content = The net outputs blob with shape: 1, 1, 200, 7 in the format 1, 1, N, 7, where N is the number of detected bounding boxes. Each detection has the format [image_id, label, conf, x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max], where:
