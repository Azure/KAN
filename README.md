# Percept Open Source Project (POSS)

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Azure Percept Open-Source Project is a framework for creating, deploying, and operating environment-aware soltions at scale that use artificial intelligence (AI) at the edge with the control and flexibility of open-source natively on your environment. POSS is fully open-sourced and leverages the open-source software (OSS) community to deliver enhanced experiences. And, as a self-managed solution, you can host the experience on your own [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) clusters.

POSS has a no- to low-code portal experience as well as APIs that can be used to build custom Edge AI applications. It supports running Edge AI apps by utilizing cameras and Edge devices with different Edge runtimes and accelerators across multiple locations at scale. Since it is designed with machine learning operations (MLOps) in mind, it provides support for active learning, continuous training, and data gathering using your machine learning (ML) models running at the edge.

# Characteristics

- **An integrated developer experience.** 
    
    You can easily build camera-based Edge AI apps using first- and third-party ML models. In one seamless flow, you can leverage pre-built models from our partnerâ€™s Model Zoo and create your own ML models with [Azure Custom Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/#overview).
- **Solution deployment and management experience at scale**. 
    
    POSS is Kubernetes native, so you can run the management experience wherever [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) runs; on prem, hybrid, cloud, or multi-cloud environments. You can manage your experience using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) native tools such as [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/), and/or our no- to low-code native web portal. Edge AI apps and assets you create are projected and managed as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) objects, which allows you to rely on the [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) control plane to manage the state of your Edge AI assets across many environments at scale. Each POSS solution can span multiple environments meaning that your solution can have one component running on [AKS on Azure Stack HCI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/aks-hci/) and another component running on [EFLOW](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/iot-enterprise/azure-iot-edge-for-linux-on-windows) and POSS can control your solution as one manageable unit.

- **Standard-based.**

    POSS is built on and supports popular industrial standards, protocols, and frameworks like [Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC-UA)](https://opcfoundation.org/about/opc-technologies/opc-ua/), [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/), [Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr)](https://dapr.io/), [Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)](https://mqtt.org/), [Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)](https://onnx.ai/), [Akri](https://github.com/project-akri/akri), [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/), [Helm](https://helm.sh/), and many others. 

- **Zero-friction adoption**

    Even without any Edge hardware, you can get started with a few commands, then seamlessly transit from prototype/pilot to production at scale. POSS has an easy-to-use no- to low-code portal experience that allows developers to create and manage Edge AI solutions in minutes instead of days or months. 

- **Azure powered and platform agnostic**

    POSS natively uses and supports Azure Edge and AI Services like [Azure IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/), [Azure IoT Edge](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-edge/), [Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/), [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/category/storage/), [Azure ML](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/), [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/) and so on. At the same time, it also allows you to modify the experience for use cases that require the use of other services (Azure or non-Azure) or other Open-Source Software (OSS) tools.
