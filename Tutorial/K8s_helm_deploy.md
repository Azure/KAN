# Deploy VisionOnEdge solution onto AKS/AKS-HCI using our Helm Chart

Kubernetes provides a distributed platform for containerized applications. In this tutorial, you will learn how to deploy VisionOnEdge solution to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster on the cloud or Azure Stack HCI (AKS-HCI) at the edge using VisionOnEdge Helm Chart. **For more information, about the chart, including chart version, app version, and changeable parameters, please visit [VisionOnEdge Helm Chart](VoE_Helm_Chart.md) page.**

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you would need an Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create one for free on the  [Azure sign-up page](https://aka.ms/createazuresubscription).

This article assumes that you have an existing AKS/AKS-HCI cluster deployed and have access to the cluster using `kubectl` command (more information [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/access-cluster/#accessing-for-the-first-time-with-kubectl)). If you need an AKS/AKS-HCI cluster, Please see the following documentation to create your desired cluster:

- AKS:  
  - [Create using the Azure CLI](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/master/articles/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough.md) or 
  - [Create using the Azure portal](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/master/articles/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough-portal.md)
- AKS-HCI (recommended for edge deployment): 
  - [Create using PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/aks-hci/kubernetes-walkthrough-powershell) or
  - [Create using Windows Admin Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/aks-hci/setup) 
  - If you don't have access to an Azure Stack HCI and would still like to evaluate AKS-HCI please follow [this evaluation guide](https://github.com/Azure/aks-hci/tree/main/eval) that deploys AKS-HCI inside of an Azure VM.

You need the Azure CLI version 2.0.59 or later installed and configured. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/master/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Lastly, the device that you are using to deploy VoE needs to have the latest version Helm installed. If you don't have helm installed, you can do so by following the [instructions here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/). 

## Deploy/Configure Required Azure Resources

VisionOnEdge uses/requires the following two Azure resources to function. Azure IoT Hub and registered IoT Edge devices within IoT Hub act as a messaging broker that enables the communication between VisionOnEdge deployment and the Azure Cloud. Azure Custom Vision, on the other hand, is used for training ML models, optimizing for customer-specific workloads.  

### IoT Hub

#### Create IoT Hub and Register an IoT Edge Device

If you already have an IoT Hub deployment with a registered IoT Edge device, you can skip this step. Otherwise:

1. Follow the "Create an IoT hub" section of [this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/quickstart-linux?view=iotedge-2018-06#create-an-iot-hub) to create an IoT Hub resource on Azure. 
2. Follow the "Register an IoT Edge device" section of [this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/quickstart-linux?view=iotedge-2018-06#register-an-iot-edge-device) to register an IoT Edge device (AKS/AKS-HCI cluster will be the edge device for messaging purposes)

#### Retrieve your IoT Hub and IoT Edge device's connection string

You need your Azure IoT Hub and registered IoT Edge device's connection string during deployment to AKS/AKS-HCI. Please retrieve the appropriate connection strings using the following commands:

For IoT Hub connection string:

`az iot hub connection-string show --hub-name <your_iothub_name>`

For IoT Edge device connection string:

`az iot hub device-identity connection-string show --hub-name <your_iothub_name> --device-id <your_edge_device_name>`

### Custom Vision

#### Create a Custom Vision Resource

If you already have a Custom Vision Resource, you can skip this step. Otherwise, create a Custom Vision Resource by visiting [the following link](https://www.customvision.ai/projects#/settings) and selecting "create new".

#### Retrieve your Custom Vision key and endpoint:

You need your Custom Vision key and endpoint during deployment to AKS/AKS-HCI. You can retrieve them by going to [the following link](https://www.customvision.ai/projects#/settings) and expanding your desired custom vision resource.

## Deploy VoE onto AKS/AKS-HCI

Now you are ready to deploy VoE onto your AKS/AKS-HCI cluster. Make sure the system that you are using to deploy VoE has access to your cluster (you can perform `kubectl` commands against your cluster). For more information on access, please visit the following links depending on your platform of choice: [Access AKS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/control-kubeconfig-access), [Access AKS-HCI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/aks-hci/ad-sso)

### Create a values.yaml file

As mentioned before, VoE requires Azure IoT Hub and Custom Vision as a dependency. You need to provide authentication values (the keys and connection strings you retrieved above) to the Helm installer so that it can properly authenticate and use the Azure Services during deployment. There are many ways to provide these required values during installation. You can use the `--set` flag in Helm to provide the values. A simpler and cleaner way to do this is to use a `values.yaml` file in which you input all of your desired values for our Helm installer to use (instead of using `--set` multiple times for each value). For more information about customizing Helm chart for installation please review [this document by Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#customizing-the-chart-before-installing). 

Please create a file named `values.yaml` and fill it with the following required values, replacing <...> placeholders with your authentication values:

  ```
  azureIoT:
    hubConnectionString: <your-IoTHub-connection-string>
    edgeConnectionString: <your-IoTEdgeDevice-connection-string>

  customVision:
    endPoint: <your-CustomVision-endpoint>
    key: <your-CustomVision-key>
  ```
  
  **Note: If you would like to change other values besides the above required ones, please visit [this document](VoE_Helm_Chart.md) that lists all of the available values to change**

### Deploy VisionOnEdge

You can deploy VisionOnEdge to AKS/AKS-HCI's default namespace using the following command (replace <...> with path to your values.yaml created above):

```
helm install voe-k8s https://aka.ms/VoEHelm -f <path-to-your-values.yaml-file>
```

If you would like to deploy the solution onto another namespace, you can do so using `-n` flag. As an example the command below deploys VisionOnEdge onto `fac-ai` namespace:

```
helm install voe-k8s https://aka.ms/VoEHelm -f <path-to-your-values.yaml-file> -n fac-ai
```

One thing to note is that `fac-ai` namespace should have already been created for the above command to work. You should see the following after deployment:

#### Note: CPU is the default runtime during deployment, you can enable GPU runtime for the solution by using the flag `--set runtime.accelerator="GPU"` or alternatively, you can enable VPU runtime by using the flag `--set runtime.accelerator="VPU"` during installation. In addition to the GPU flag, If you are deploying the solution onto Azure Stack Edge Kubernetes, please add the flag `--set runtime.stackEdge=true` for successful GPU deployment.  Please make sure appropriate Nvidia drivers are installed on all your Kubernetes nodes. For AKS, you can follow [this documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/gpu-cluster#install-nvidia-device-plugin) to install appropriate drivers. 

## Manage your VisionOnEdge deployment

### Upgrade/Update deployment

You can use the following command to upgrade your VoE deployment:

```
helm upgrade voe-k8s https://aka.ms/VoEHelm --reuse-values -n fac-ai -f <path-to-your-values.yaml-file>
```

The command above will reuse values used in your previous release unless you override them using the `values.yaml` file. If you don't want to use values from the previous release you can instead use the following command: 

```
helm upgrade voe-k8s https://aka.ms/VoEHelm -n fac-ai -f <path-to-your-values.yaml-file>
```

### Delete deployment

You can delete VisionOnEdge from your cluster using the following command:

```
helm delete voe-k8s -n fac-ai
```

The above command deletes VoE from namespace `fac-ai` assuming you used `fac-ai` namespace during installation. If you installed VoE onto another namespace, please replace `fac-ai` with the namespace name you used during installation.
