# KAN: Setup guide

## Prerequisites

KAN runs with or without Azure. When you configure KAN with Azure, you get additional features like:
* Sending inference results to IoT Hub
* Automatic uploading video snippets to Azure Storage account
* Leveraging Azure Custom Vision models
On the other hand, you can get started with KAN without an Azure account.

### Run without Azure

* A **Kubernetes cluster**. 

  If you don't have an existing Kubernetes cluster, you can easily create one using the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). For more information, visit [Quickstart: Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using the Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal?tabs=azure-cli). Make sure to choose Standard DS3 v2 for the node size.

* A **Bash Shell**, such as WSL, Azure Cloud CLI, or a Terminal on Mac.
* **Helm** v3.8 or higher.

### Run with Azure

To run with Azure, in addition to above items, youâ€™ll also need:

* An active **Azure subscription** with **Owner** role access. 

KAN installer script will guide you through the steps of creating related Azure resources (see more details below).

## Setup process 

1. Open your shell terminal.
2. Download and launch the installer script:
   ```bash
   wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/KAN/main/Installer/kan-installer.sh -O - | /bin/bash
   ```
3. The first question the script asks is if you want to run KAN with or without Azure. Enter ```y``` to deploy KAN with Azure, otherwise enter ```n```.
   ```bash
   azure user?(y/n):
   ```
   > **NOTE**: Later, you can run the installer script again to choose a different route.

## Setup process - with Azure
4. Next, you can choose to configure KAN on an existing AKS cluster, or to use your current Kubernetes context, which can point to any local or remote Kubernetes clusters.
   ```bash
   Would you like to use a exists aks, or use current kubeconfig?
   1) use an existing one
   2) use current kubeconfig
   Your answer:
   ```
   If your chose ```1```, the script lists out all your AKS clusters, and you can select the cluster by entering the cluster index. If you chose ```2```, the script continues with your current Kubernetes context.

5. Next, you have options to create a new Azure Storage Account, use an existing one, or skip the step:
   ```bash
   Would you like to create a new storage account, or use an existing one?
   1) create a new one
   2) use an existing one
   3) skip
   4) back to previous step
   Your answer:
   ```
   > **NOTE**: You won't be able to view camera snapshots or uploaded video clips without an Azure Storage Account.

   If you chose either ```1``` or ```2```, you then need to choose whether you want to create new storage container, or use an existing one.
   ```bash
   Would you like to create a new blob container, or use an existing one?
   In order to perform this operation please make sure you have a Storage contributor role on your subscription
   1) create a new one
   2) use an existing one
   3) back to previous step
   Your answer:
   ```
6. Next, you can choose which Azure Cognitive Services account to use, or to create a new one:
   ```bash
   Would you like to create a new cognitive services, or use an existing one?
   1) create a new one
   2) use an existing one
   3) skip
   4) back to previous step
   ```
7. The next step is to choose an Azure Service Principal to use. We recommend creating a new one with the script in your initial setup, and reuse the same principal in subsequent script runs. Also, if you work with an Azure AD tenant with many service principals, we recommend choosing ```3``` instead of ```2``` as enumerating all service principals may take a long time.
   ```bash
   Would you like to create a new service principal, or use an existing one?
   1) create a new one
   2) use an existing one
   3) use an existing one by entering name
   4) skip
   5) back to previous step
   ```
8. Once you've made all selections, answer ```y``` to confirm. And the script will setup all required Azure resources for you.
   ```bash
   your selections:
   aks:                            Use current kubeconfig
   service_principal:              kan-sp
   storage account:                byom/byom
   storage account location:
   blob container:                 clips
   cognitive services:             byom/vision
   cognitive services location:
   Are you sure (y or n)?
   ```
9. After all resources are configured and KAN installed, the script displays your portal URL. Open the URL with a browser and you are ready to go!
## Setup process - without Azure

4. Scripts asks you to confirm to install KAN to the Kubernetes cluster configured as your current cluster. Answer `y` to continue.
   ```bash
   kan will install on current kubeconfig: (y/n)
   ```
5. Answer `y` to confirm installation:
   ```bash
    your selections:
    aks:                            Use current kubeconfig
    service_principal:              skip
    storage account:                skip
    storage account location:       skip
    blob container:                 skip
    cognitive services:             skip
    cognitive services location:    skip
    Are you sure (y or n)?
   ```
6. After all resources are configured and KAN installed, the script displays your portal URL. Open the URL with a browser and you are ready to go!

## Limit access to the KAN portal
Now that you have successfully setup KAN experience onto your Kubernetes environment, we recommend first securing your portal.

## Uninstall KAN
You can uninstall KAN using Helm:

```bash
helm uninstall kanportal
helm uninstall kan
```
